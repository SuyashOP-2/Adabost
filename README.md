AdaBoost, short for Adaptive Boosting, is a machine learning algorithm that helps improve the accuracy of weak models (typically simple or slightly better than random chance) by combining them to create a stronger model. It's like having a team of weak players and training them in a way that they become a strong team together.

Here's a simple explanation of how AdaBoost works:

Training Weak Models (Classifiers): AdaBoost starts by training multiple weak models (e.g., decision trees or simple rules), each attempting to classify data correctly. These weak models are often referred to as "base classifiers."

Assigning Weights: AdaBoost assigns equal weights to all data points initially.

Learning and Updating Weights: In each iteration, AdaBoost focuses on the data points that the current weak models got wrong. It increases the importance (weight) of the misclassified points and decreases the weight of correctly classified points. This makes the next weak model focus more on the previously misclassified data points.

Combining Weak Models: The weak models' outputs are combined by taking a weighted majority vote. The models that perform better get more say in the final prediction.

Iterative Process: Steps 3 and 4 are repeated for a predefined number of iterations or until the model performs well enough.

Final Strong Model: The combination of all these weighted weak models forms a strong model, which is capable of making accurate predictions.

In simple terms, think of AdaBoost as a process where you train a series of simple models, and you give more attention to the data points that these models find difficult to classify. This way, the next model focuses on what the previous ones struggled with. By combining all these models, you get a robust and accurate model that can handle complex tasks.

AdaBoost is a technique used in the ensemble learning family of machine learning methods, and it's particularly good at handling tasks like face detection, text classification, and more, where there might be complex patterns to learn from the data
